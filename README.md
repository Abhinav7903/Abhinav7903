### About Me

Senior Software Engineer and founding team member at **Hornet Decentratech Pvt. Ltd.**, with ownership of backend architecture and production systems in security-critical environments.

I work primarily on **distributed backend systems**, **blockchain infrastructure**, and **crypto-forensics platforms**, focusing on scalability, reliability, and operational robustness. I have experience taking systems from early design to production deployment and scaling them under real-world constraints.

Based in India.
